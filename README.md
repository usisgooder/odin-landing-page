# Odin Landing Page project

My attempt at replicating a given webpage from a given design. This webpage is built using HTML and CSS from the groundup without
other frameworks and plugins. The main purpose of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of flexbox, and there may be
missing features outside the scope of the current course.
